        In our daily life, parabolas or near parabolas exist everywhere. Thrown objects, bridges and buildings are just a few examples in our daily life of where parabolas can exist. Structures such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the St. Louis Arch are great examples of how parabolas can be incorporated in art and architecture. In physics, the path an object takes when thrown into the air can be represented as a parabola. In this specific field, parabolas are very important geometric representations that can give valuable data about specific objects. In buildings, parabolas are visually appealing and to a point very structurally sound. Parabolas were used as early as the Roman times, when aqueducts were used to transform water from the mountains down to the city. Parabolas are widely used in our world, and for good reason. They are a very important part of our daily life.

        Equation:<BR> 
To figure out all of these equations, we used this formula:<BR> 
<BR>
Σ x x = [ Σ x 2 ] - [ ( Σ x )2 / n ]<BR>
 Σ x y = [ Σ x y ] - [ ( Σ x * Σ y ) / n ]<BR>
 Σ x x2 = [ Σ x 3 ] - [ ( Σ x 2 * Σ x ) / n ] <BR>
Σ x2 y = [ Σ x 2 y] - [ ( Σ x 2 * Σ y ) / n ] <BR>
Σ x2 x2 = [ Σ x 4 ] - [ ( Σ x 2 )2 / n ]<BR> 
X and y are the Variables. a, b, and c are the Coefficients of the Quadratic Equation n = Number of Values or Elements Σ x= Sum of First Scores <BR>
Σ y = Sum of Second Scores <BR>
Σ x2 = Sum of square of First Scores <BR>
Σ x 3 = Sum of Cube of First Scores <BR>
Σ x 4 = Sum of Power Four of First Scores <BR>
Σ xy= Sum of the Product of First and Second Scores <BR>
Σ x2y = Sum of Square of First Scores and Second Scores<BR>
